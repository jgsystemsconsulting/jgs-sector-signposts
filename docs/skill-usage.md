# Using the knowledge packs

## Prerequisites

- A host that reads [Agent Skills](https://github.com/agentskills/agentskills): Claude Code,
  GitHub Copilot CLI, or Amp.
- Packs installed into your skills directory (see the repo README: `python install.py`).
- No MCP server, API key, or licence tier is needed at runtime; packs are plain Markdown.

## Invoking a pack

Each pack is a skill named by its slug. After installing and restarting your agent:

```bash
/<slug>                      # no argument: load the pack's core frameworks for reference
/<slug> <topic>              # a topic: the pack routes to the right chapter and answers
/<slug> ch20                 # a chapter id: load that chapter directly
/<slug> what chapters do you have?   # browse the index
```

In normal conversation you often don't need the slash at all: each pack's `description`
makes the agent load it when your question matches its topics (for example, "what does
this body of knowledge say about traceability?").

## How a pack answers

A pack uses progressive disclosure so a large source doesn't fill your context window:

- `SKILL.md` (always loaded) holds the core frameworks plus a **topic index** and **chapter
  index**.
- `chapters/chNN-*.md` are loaded **on demand**, only the chapter your question routes to.
- `glossary.md`, `patterns.md`, `cheatsheet.md` are loaded when relevant.

So the agent reads `SKILL.md`, decides which one chapter answers your question, and loads
just that.

## The /signposts orchestrator

`signposts` is not a knowledge pack: it carries no source content. On an explicit
`/signposts <question>` it matches your question to installed packs through a curated
routing map (topics, agency contexts, deliverables), reads them, and answers with pack and
chapter citations. Use it when you do not know which `/<slug>` to ask. Bare
`/signposts` prints usage and examples.

Modes and gates:

- **Narrow consult** (one topic row matches, at most one agency): reads the best single
  pack, no gate, ends with "Also relevant" runners-up.
- **Broad consult** (two or more rows or agencies, or a compare/contrast/survey verb): one
  plan approval naming the packs, then it runs to done; disagreements are listed per source,
  never averaged.
- **Deliverable** (an artifact verb plus a deliverable name): plan approval, then stage
  pauses after Draft and after Review. Draft builds the artifact with citations; Review
  lists cited findings and a revised artifact; Verify is a results table only (no edits).
  A review/verify request on a user artifact starts at that stage. No matching row: name
  closest Deliverables rows or offer a broad consult; never improvise a chain.

Every claim cites a file read that session, as `[slug chNN]`, `[slug index]`, or
`[slug glossary|patterns|cheatsheet]`, and every answer ends with a **Sources** block
listing each pack's source and licence (Licences table, else `Public Domain (US Government work)`;
signposts as `MIT (signpost)`; NC/SA terms in full). Host modes: with sub-agents it reads
packs in parallel (failed brief reruns in the main thread); otherwise in sequence; on
transform installs it reads the inlined index files, names chapters as follow-ups, and
labels the answer `index-level`; when no member file is readable it reports the route only
and makes no Rail, Space, and Maritime claims. Agency filter keeps candidates on named agency rows when one
survives, else keeps all and says so. Thin packs step down to the next on the row.

## Scope & honesty

Each pack's `SKILL.md` states what its source is **thin** on. Knowledge packs are reference
oracles over one source. Best for "what does this body of knowledge say about X?" and
"give me X's framework for Y." They are not a substitute for your own judgement, and they
only know their one source.

## Licensing reminder

Pack **content** is licensed under its source's own terms (see each `packs/<slug>/LICENSE`
and the root `NOTICE`). Non-commercial (NC) packs may not be used for commercial purposes;
share-alike (SA) packs must keep their licence on any derivative. The repository **tooling**
is MIT. See [LICENSING.md](LICENSING.md).
